# Wordle Recognition Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. ✅ Double Declaration Bug
- **Problem**: `totalPixels` was declared twice (line 1334 and 1450)
- **Solution**: Commented out redundant declaration at line 1450
- **Impact**: Eliminates variable shadowing and potential bugs

### 2. ✅ Grid Cell Extraction Misalignment
- **Problem**: Blue boxes showed correct boundaries but cell analysis was misaligned
- **Solution**: Fixed getImageData parameters to use proper integer coordinates
- **Code**: Lines 646-650 in test-recognition.html

### 3. ✅ Preprocessing Issues
- **Problems**:
  - Letters O, R, B became completely white after preprocessing
  - Some letters had black text on white background, others white on black
  - Thin stroke letters (T, I, L) disappeared
- **Solutions**:
  - Implemented Otsu's thresholding method for automatic threshold detection
  - Added edge vs center pixel analysis for proper inversion
  - Added morphological dilation for thin strokes (<5% black pixels)
  - Fallback method when Otsu fails (>95% white/black pixels)
- **Code**: preprocessForOCR function (lines 1322-1553)

### 4. ✅ Color Scheme Detection
- **Problem**: Different websites have different color palettes
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented website-specific color schemes (wordle2.io, lessgames.com)
  - Added automatic URL-based detection
  - Manual selection dropdown in test page
- **Files**: 
  - Created colorSchemeDetector.ts
  - Updated imageRecognition.ts to use detector

### 5. ✅ OCR Debug Panel
- **Problem**: No visibility into OCR processing stages
- **Solution**: 
  - Added interactive debug panel
  - Shows preprocessing stages visually
  - Displays confidence scores for all detected letters
  - Click any cell to see OCR analysis
- **Code**: Lines 285-402, 410-421, 1791-1865

## Key Improvements

### Preprocessing Algorithm (Lines 1322-1553)
```javascript
1. Calculate histogram for all pixels
2. Use Otsu's method to find optimal threshold
3. Determine if background is dark or light
4. Adjust threshold based on color scheme
5. Apply binary thresholding
6. Analyze edge vs center pixels for inversion decision
7. Apply morphological dilation for thin strokes
8. Output white background with black text (OCR standard)
```

### Color Scheme Support
- **wordle2.io**: Light theme with specific RGB values
- **lessgames.com/wordless**: Dark theme with different palette
- **auto**: Universal algorithm for other sites

### Letter Recognition Flow
1. Detect letter presence using multiple strategies
2. Preprocess image with Otsu's thresholding
3. Use Tesseract.js with single-character mode
4. Fallback to enhanced contrast if confidence < 50%
5. Display results with confidence scores

## Testing Instructions

1. Open `test-recognition.html` in browser
2. Upload or drag a Wordle screenshot
3. Select appropriate color scheme from dropdown:
   - wordle2.io for wordle2.io screenshots
   - lessgames.com for lessgames.com/wordless screenshots
   - auto for other sites
4. Click any cell in "格子分析" section to see OCR debug info
5. Check recognition results and confidence scores

## Validation
Run `node validate-fixes.js` to verify all fixes are properly implemented.

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring letter recognition accuracy
- Test with various Wordle screenshots from different websites
- Fine-tune thresholds if needed for specific problematic letters
